# Basics
Build generic chest (each type)
Multi-build (all chests should convert to the selected one)
Mine each one (make sure it turns back into generic in inventory)
UI close button works
- Clears this chest from multi-place list
UI closes if chest is removed


# Blueprint
Should swap to generic on building blueprint
Should swap back when placed by bots (implicit in game now)
Storage filter
Request filter
Circuit connections to ghosts (if chest or other entity built first)


# Upgrading
Works (implicit in game now)


# Chest swapping
Circuit connections
Complex items in generic chest are fine after being changed


# Copy Paste
Triggers a chest swap
Can copy OG chest to work for generics
Copies filter settings (I think this is just the game doing it after the swap)
Can't copy between different chest groups


# Pipette Selection
Both generic and replacement
Can pipette ghosts as well


# Fast Replace
Can build a generic on a normal chest and it will swap to the replacement
Building a generic on a replacement will fast replace to the generic & open UI

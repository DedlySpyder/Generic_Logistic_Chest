# Basics
Build generic chest (each type)
Multi-build (all chests should convert to the selected one)
Mine each one (make sure it turns back into generic in inventory)
UI close button works
- Clears this chest from multi-place list
UI closes if chest is removed


# Blueprint
Should swap to generic on building blueprint
Should swap back when placed by bots
Storage filter
Request filter
Circuit connections to ghosts (if chest or other entity built first) (as of Factorio 1.1)


# Chest swapping
Circuit connections
Complex items in generic chest are fine after being changed


# Copy Paste
Triggers a chest swap
Can copy OG chest to work for generics
Copies filter settings (I think this is just the game doing it after the swap)
Can't copy between different chest groups
